My understanding is that we do not need to connect to a mongoDB or any other database.
All the to do items must be stored in an array which has Id as the key. //I can choose another data type if this is not the assumption. 
My whole program is made based on above assumptions. If anything is incorrect. Pls let me know and I can correct it.
